1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
A. True and False are the two values of Boolean data type.We can write them as capital T and F and rest of letters are lowercase letters.


2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
A. AND, OR and NOT are the three boolean operators.


3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
A. True and True is True.
   True and False is False.
   False and True is False.
   False and False is False.
   
   True or True is True.
   True or False is True.
   False or True is True.
   False or False is False.
  
   not True is False.
   not False is True.

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
A. (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                   ------  False
   not (5 > 4)                            ------  False
   (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                    ------  True
   not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))              ------  False
   (True and True) and (True == False)    ------  False
   (not False) or (not True)              ------  True
 


5. What are the six comparison operators?
A. Less than ( < )
   Less than or equal to ( <= )
   Greater than ( > )
   Greater than or equal to ( >= )
   Equal to ( == )
   Not equal to ( != )


6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
A. The '=' is an assignment operator used to assign the value (on the right) to the variable (on the left). 
   The '==' is an equal operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not. If equal it returns True otherwise it returns False.


7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
    spam = 0
    if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
    print('bacon')
    else:
    print('ham')
    print('spam')
    print('spam')
A.  Three blocks i this code are eggs, bacon and ham.


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
A. spam = int(input())
   if spam == 1:
   	print('Hello')
    elif spam == 2:
    	print('Howdy')
    else:
   	print('Greetings!')


9.  If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
A.  If programme is stuck in an endless loop we have to use break statement or press (Ctrl+c) key to break.


10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
A.  break -- it terminates the execution of the current loop and passes the control over the next loop or main body
    continue -- it skips the current iteration and executes the very next iteration in the loop.


11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
A.  range(10)     --- 
    range(0,10)   --- prints from 0 to 9
    range(0,10,1) --- prints from 0 to 9 with step value 1


12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
A.  Using for loop:
    for i in range(1, 11):
    	print(i)
    Using while loop:
    i = 1
    while i <= 10:
	print(i)
	i = i+1


13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?   
A.  spam.bacon()
